# NumPy ML Projects

A collection of Machine Learning projects built from scratch using NumPy.

## Projects

### 1. Search Engine
A semantic search engine that finds the most relevant topics for any query using cosine similarity and confidence scoring.

**Concepts used:**
- Cosine similarity
- Vector embeddings

```bash
python search_engine.py
```

## About
Built as part of my AI/ML learning journey. All projects implemented from scratch without high-level ML libraries to demonstrate core understanding.
