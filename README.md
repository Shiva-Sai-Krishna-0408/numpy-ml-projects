# NumPy ML Projects

A collection of Machine Learning projects built from scratch using NumPy.

## Projects

### 1. Search Engine
A semantic search engine that finds the most relevant topics for any query using cosine similarity and confidence scoring.

**Concepts used:**
- Cosine similarity
- Vector embeddings
- Sum normalization
- Confidence distribution

**How to run:**
```bash
python search_engine.py
```

### 2. Student Score Analyzer
Normalizes student exam scores across 5 subjects and categorizes them into High, Mid, and Low performance groups.

**Concepts used:**
- Min-Max normalization
- Array operations
- Performance categorization

**How to run:**
```bash
python student_score_analyzer.py
```

### 3. Movie Recommender
Recommends the top 2 movies for each user based on their preference vectors using cosine similarity.

**Concepts used:**
- Cosine similarity
- Dot product
- Vector normalization
- Sorting by similarity score

**How to run:**
```bash
python movie_recommender.py
```

## About
Built as part of my AI/ML learning journey. All projects implemented from scratch without high-level ML libraries to demonstrate core understanding.
